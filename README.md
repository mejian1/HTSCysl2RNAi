## RNAi Screen Data Analysis Workflow

**Data Preparation**
1. Prepare an Excel file containing the raw data from your RNAi screen.

**Data Upload**
2. Upload the Excel file to a Python-compatible platform or environment.

**Script Execution**
3. Run the reproducible Python scripts to analyze the RNAi screen data.
